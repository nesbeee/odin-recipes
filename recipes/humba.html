        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Humba is a Filipino braised pork dish that is very popular in the Visayan and southern regions. Said to be a derivative of the Chinese Hong-ba (also Hong-Shao-Rou or Red Braised Pork Belly). It is believed that it was introduced by Chinese immigrants and was adapted by our Visaya folks. They replaced some of the ingredients like Shaoxing wine and five-spices with what is more easily found locally. Ginger is also omitted and instead, tausi is used.</p>
                
            <p>Like any others, there are different manners of cooking this dish. Some people would marinate the meat first before searing. Others would skip the searing part entirely.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
                <li>700 grams pork belly, cut into 1x2-inch sizes</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup vinegar</li>
                <li>2 cups water; add more if needed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon peppercorn</li>
                <li>2 pieces bay leaves</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dried banana blossoms (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fermented black beans (tausi)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup pineapple tidbits, liquids included (optional)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sear pork belly until lightly browned and fats are rendered. Set fried pork aside. Remove excess oil from the pot and leave just about 2 tablespoons.</li>
                <li>In the same pot, saute garlic until golden and aromatic. Add back the pork belly and stir.</li>
                <li>Add the rest of the ingredients and stir. Cover the pot and let it simmer for 40-50 minutes or until pork is tender. Add more water if needed until meat is fork-tender.</li>
                <li>Remove the cover and continue to simmer until liquid is reduced to a thick sauce.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a serving dish and serve with plain rice.</li>
            </ol>
