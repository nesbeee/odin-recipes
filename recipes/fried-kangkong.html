                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

                <li>cooking oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the leaves of the kangkong from the stem.</li>
                <li>Wash and clean the kangkong leaves thoroughly under running water to remove dirt. Then wipe it to dry.</li>
                <li>Dredge the kangkong leaves individually in cornstarch and set them aside.</li>
                <li>Make the batter. Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, egg, salt and pepper. Pour in ice cold water and mix well. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat up enough cooking oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat.</li>
                <li>When the oil is hot enough, dip the kangkong leaves in the prepared batter one after the other. Then fry until golden and crisp, about 1 to 2 minutes. Note: Repeat the same process or steps until all the kangkong leaves are cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove from the pan, let the oil drain, then transfer to a serving plate lined with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Serve it crisp with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
